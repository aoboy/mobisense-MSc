These Files are part of my Master Thesis in Network Services and Systems at The Royal Institute of Technology -  Stockholm.   PacketAnalyzerC and PacketAnalyzerP aims to analyze traffic from sensors. This includes any traffic from sensors. Is also possible to filter incoming traffic by source, destination addresses , either using both source and destination addresses  together.  Future implementations will focus on implementing the filtering in the routing header. This part awaits further  developments in the routing algorithm that is also part of this Project.
